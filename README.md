This repository demonstrates a common data race error in Rust when modifying a vector without proper synchronization mechanisms. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version using a mutex to prevent data races.  The bug occurs because the vector's memory might be reallocated internally, potentially leading to undefined behavior if multiple threads access it concurrently. Note that using `unsafe` code does not inherently prevent this error, and merely suppresses the compiler's safety checks.
